        <p>Setting a strong password is always the first step towards cybersecurity. A good password contains both <strong>uppercase</strong> and <strong>lowercase</strong> letters, <strong>numbers</strong> and <strong>special characters</strong>. If this is too hard for you to remember, you could also create a <strong>"passphrase"</strong> which is 3 random words stringed together.<br><br>It is good practice to <strong>not</strong> repeat passwords across accounts: if one of your passwords is breached, it is possible <strong>all</strong> the other accounts which share it could be in jeopardy. You should not make your password something like a real phrase or a password that is bad for <em>obvious</em> reasons (i.e. 'password', '12345' etc.).<br><br>Click on the <strong>GO</strong> button to view the statistics page for <strong>passwords</strong>.</p>

        <p>A factor that defines cybersecurity strongly is privacy. However, even if you maintain privacy on the internet, there may still be threat actors violating your privacy without your knowledge. They achieve this through many methods wich allow them to connect themselves to your systems. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Evil twins</strong> - malicious wifi networks impersonating legitimate ones</li>
          <li><strong>Malware</strong> - malicious software which compromises your computer and can be transmitted through suspicious downloads, <a href = "phishing.html" >phishing</a> etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Hacking</strong> - malicious programmers with a strong knowledge of systems which connect to and breach systems.</li>

        <p>Phishing is a type of cyber threat where a threat actor <strong>impersonates</strong> a legitimate person or organisation via <strong>email</strong> and either demands money in some way or provides a link to a malicious website where your data may get stolen or you may get malware.<br><br>Commonly, phishing attacks impersonate <strong>banks or taxation agencies</strong>, saying your bills are overdue or <strong>online retail</strong> companies giving you an unsolicited refund. <strong>Smishing</strong> is an increasingly common version of phishing in which the threat actor communicates via <strong>SMS</strong> and <strong>spearphishing</strong> is <strong>targeted</strong> phishing using information such as your name and some personal details that make the attack more convincing.<br><br>Click on the <strong>GO</strong> button to view the statistics page for <strong>phishing</strong>.</p>

        <p>Backups are a way to ensure that even if all else fails and your computer or data is <strong>breached, corrupted or stolen,</strong> you have a <strong>secure</strong> way to recover your important information. Backups can be manually created by copying your entire disk or select files onto an <strong>external</strong> drive or automatically using the operating system's settings to either the <strong>cloud</strong> or an <strong>external</strong> disk.<br><br>It is good practice to make backups at least on a <strong>monthly</strong> basis but you could make them more often if you have important data stored. After creating a backup, if you (for example) get malware on your computer, you can simply factory reset the machine to eliminate the malware and then <strong>restore</strong> the most recent backup. Thus, backups are an essential tool in maintaining your cybersecurity.<br><br>Click on the <strong>GO</strong> button to view the statistics page for <strong>backups</strong>.</p>

        <p>Another way to protect yourself online is by keeping safe secifically on <strong>social media</strong>. You'd be surprised as to how much someone can find out about you just by looking through your social media profiles.<br><br>This information can become <strong>increasingly sensitive and personal</strong> as you share more and more, and can include your full name, date of birth, location, school/workplace and anything else that you reveal, even subtly through images. To avoid this, you should avoid oversharing online and make sure you take into account that your online footprint is <strong>permanent</strong>. This means anything that you post online will most likely stay online <strong>indefinitely.</strong><br><br>Click on the <strong>GO</strong> button to view the statistics page for <strong>staying safe on social media</strong>.</p>
