## Introduction
This project is part of an assessment that I need to complete for my current computing course in school. It also happens to be my first **major** programming project (practically all of my previous projects were small or just tests). It is mainly assessing my skills in HTML and CSS. JavaScript found in here was added by me for functionality and not being assessed. The main purpose of the site is to provide information about a topic (I chose cybersecurity out of the given options, hence the "Securi-smart" site name) <br> If you come by some inefficiencies &mdash; such as the fact I used buttons instead of links to navigate around the site &mdash; it's because, aside from basics, I learnt quite a bit as I went along and improved a lot in this way, but fixing very fundamental things that have already been styled, tested etc. such as the aforementioned buttons is above my will to live. Therefore, although you *will* find some things that may confuse you, there are a lot of other even *more* confusing things that were there *previously* and were fixed through much effort.

## Site-Features
- Home page - general information about cybersecurity and the site itself
- Selection page - gives the user detailed information about five aspects of cybersecurity and the ability to pick from them to learn some statistics about them
- Aspect pages - contain statistics and interactive elements to educate the user on each aspect of cybersecurity

## Design-Features
- Simple and clean design - Inspiration was taken from Google's Material Design 3 and Apple's iOS
- Responsive layout - Layout is responsive and supports a small mobile layout, a medium layout for devises such as tablets, and a standard layout for laptop and monitor screens (not tested on every platform, results may vary)
- Interactive elements - Interactive elements were included both because they were required in the assesssment but also because they enhance the learning experience within "Aspect" pages

```

If my project doesn't work or run properly, too bad I guess, it's probably under maintenance or something (or just very buggy, I'm only human ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ ).

## Contributing
This repository is mainly so I can store and run the project from GitHub pages so I most likely won't be adding public pull requests. Feel free to do what you want with it by forking.
